    "intro": "In order to extract the maximum value from AI and reduce the possibility of incorrect AI conclusions or hallucinations, you need to clean and prepare your data into a format that can be integrated into an AI model or accessed at runtime.",
    "approach": "At JoeyLLM, we want to make your data-quality projects predictable and transparent. That's why we keep our pricing simple:",

        "name": "Initial Assessment",
        "price": "A$250",
        "description": "We start every engagement with a flat-fee analysis. Our experts examine your files, profile the data and identify any issues such as duplicates, missing values or inconsistent formats. You'll receive a report outlining what needs to be done and how long it's likely to take."

        "description": "For clients who have a large volume of data that they cannot transmit, or that require a working security clearance (up to NV2) to access, we can arrange for one of our data cleaning experts to attend your site. These typically require some advance notice and can book up quickly during peak periods like EOFY. Travel must be paid by the client when required."

        "name": "Hourly Cleaning",
        "price": "A$250/hr",
        "description": "After the assessment, we'll provide a fixed range of hours for the cleaning work itself. We base this quote on the complexity of your data and the tasks required (deduplication, standardisation, formatting, etc.). You'll know the minimum and maximum cost before any cleaning begins, so there are no surprises."
      }
    ],
    "example": "For example, if the assessment shows that your dataset needs eight to twelve hours of work, your quote will be A$2,000--A$3,000. We cap our hours at the high end of the range unless you choose to expand the scope by introducing additional data to the backlog.",
    "goal": "Our goal is to deliver clean, reliable data while giving you complete control over your budget.",

    "description": "Organisations looking to maintain their own in-house, offline and bespoke AIs can commission us to create a variant trained on whatever data the client requires. These AIs can be hosted on our infrastructure or installed on-site on a dedicated server. This is typically a quite involved process that requires several months, depending on the scope of the data to be integrated, specialist functionality, and number of users.",
