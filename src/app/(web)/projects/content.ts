    "title": "Praxis -- Community Resource Platform",
    "description": "Praxis is our experimental AI-powered platform for sharing know-how, labour and resources within -- and between - local communities. It started with an article called 'What if your town knew you were sad' that posited that a non-profit AI system could help fight isolation, coordinate community expertise and time, and even create a way for communities to share and trade knowledge and resources.",
    "context": "With AI-driven economic disruption an unfortunate (and fairly scary) reality, we are investigating ways that AI can be used to pull communities together and leverage their resources more effectively, especially in communities facing economic disruption.",
    "concept": "It's a big ideas project that crosses a lot of technical, cultural and discipline boundaries. While still very high concept at this stage, Praxis is a 'reciprocity engine' that tracks contributions to ensure fairness and encourages reciprocity, and treats the mental and physical well-being of individual community members as an ongoing concern."

Please include a summary of your idea, its intended impact and any resources you need. We review proposals based on feasibility, alignment with our mission and community interest. Once a project is on the board we do our best to try to support it with internal and technical resources where we can."
