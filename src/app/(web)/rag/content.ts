    "title": "What is RAG?",
    "description": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines a generative language model with a retrieval system to pull in relevant information from external documents. It improves the model's accuracy and reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in a knowledge base.",
    "workflow": "A typical RAG workflow involves splitting documents into chunks, creating vector embeddings, storing them in a database, retrieving the most relevant chunks for a query, and then feeding this context to the language model to generate a final answer.",
    "context": "The RAG system covers a vast variety of potential use cases that offer immediate and measurable benefits to businesses, but to maximise that value each solution needs to be aligned to the specific business and organisational priorities of the client. In order to put RAG systems within the reach of everyone and to create new commercial opportunities, we built the RAG Showroom: a streamlined suite of tools to rapidly stand-up applications."
  },
  "showroom": {
    "title": "Showroom Demos",
    "description": "We offer interactive demos that illustrate what RAG can do. These cover a variety of industries and organisations, everything from civil aviation, through to charities, emergency services, healthcare and more. We and our partners are continuing to add new demos to the showroom to show off the power of our system and how easily solutions can be built for it. In most cases, client-specific demos can be built in days, not months."
  },
  "builder": {
    "title": "Build Your Own",
    "description": "For those with some technical grit and a willingness to get their hands dirty, our low-code builder lets you create your own RAG applications without writing much code.",
    "process": "Upload documents, choose a base model, adjust retrieval parameters and define prompts. The builder generates an app you can embed on your site or share with others. We charge for hosting and take twenty percent of revenue earned (either as a subscription, direct sales or food delivery or a up-front fee charged to a client).",
    "freeTier": "Yes, that means if you give away the app for free or are a non-profit, we only charge hosting. If an app doesn't directly make money (say from sales or a paid subscription) you can give it away for free without restriction, so long as it abides by our user license. We also don't touch advertising revenue; so long as hosting is paid its fine to support your free apps with ads if you wish.",
    "complexity": "Note that complex tasks may require fine-tuning or additional programming. For organisations or businesses without technical expertise, we'd recommend using one of our partners. Our marketplace has a 'Request for Proposal' board for this exact purpose."
  },
  "marketplace": {
    "title": "Marketplace",
    "description": "If you build something useful, you can list it in our marketplace. Set a price, provide a description and preview link, and we handle the rest. Sales revenue is split 80/20 (your share is 80%). Please ensure your app complies with our guidelines: it must respect user privacy, avoid harmful content and clearly state any limitations. The marketplace is curated; we may remove listings that violate our policies."
