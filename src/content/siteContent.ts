        "The RAG system covers a vast variety of potential use cases that offer immediate and measurable benefits to businesses, but to maximise that value each solution needs to be aligned to the specific business and organisational priorities of the client. In order to put RAG systems within the reach of everyone and to create new commercial opportunities, we built the RAG Showroom: a streamlined suite of tools to rapidly stand-up applications.",
