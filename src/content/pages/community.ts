    "description": "Join the JoeyLLM Discord to connect with like-minded people. Our server hosts channels for general discussion, technical support, upskilling and collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, you'll find peers willing to answer questions and share ideas.",

    "description": "We believe in continuous learning and that AI is most valuable when it is combined with expertise from other fields. Our community hub lists tutorials, webinars and workshops on topics such as prompt engineering, model fine-tuning and experimental AI. Upcoming events are posted with dates and times; recordings are made available for later viewing when possible."

    "description": "We host regular online developer meetups for our community. These sessions are opportunities to discuss new features, showcase projects, and get hands-on guidance from our team. In addition to ad-hoc events, we hold a general all-hands meeting on the first Monday of every month.",
    "schedule": "Both the developer meetups and the all-hands session are organised through our Discord server. While we may list or mirror events on other platforms, the definitive schedule and access links will always be available on JoeyLLM.com.au."

    "title": "Collaborate and Mentor",
    "description": "We generally discourage unstructured mentoring or random pair-ups. Instead, the best way to learn and collaborate is by joining one of our community projects. These initiatives are curated and led by experienced members of the JoeyLLM team to ensure a positive, productive environment. Start by browsing the current projects and contributing where your skills fit---coding, documentation, data gathering, testing, or community engagement.",
    "entrepreneurial": "That said, we welcome those who have an entrepreneurial bent and working groups often form into business teams who use our RAG showroom to pitch and deliver projects to clients. And if you've already got a working team formed and are ready to hit the road, don't let us stop you. Request team access to the RAG showroom and get building solutions."
